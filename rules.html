<h1>Rules</h1>

<h3>We can’t have an excellent service without a good set of rules that our users must follow in order to ensure that we’re providing a good service.</h3>

<div class="content">

<h4>We can perfectly promise you that:</h4>

<ul>

<li>We will <b>not</b> look at your passwords.</li>

<li>We will <b>not</b> spam your e-mail addresses.</li>

</ul>

<h4>However, you need to promise that you will use your bouncer following these rules so that we can trust you as a good user.</h4>

<ul>

<li>Don’t use your bouncer for illegal stuff!</li>

<li>Make sure to log in at least once every <b>thirty</b> days.</li>

<li>Don’t connect to your bouncer through a proxy or another bouncer.</li>

<li>Spamming/Flooding while using your bouncer is <b>not</b> allowed.</li>

<li>We deserve the rights to remove your bouncer with <b>any</b> or <b>no</b> reason.</li>
