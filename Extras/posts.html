<h3>New vHosts</h3>
                <p>Today, we have acquired some vHosts! These will be: founder.dreambnc.xyz, staff.dreambnc.xyz, bots.dreambnc.xyz, user.dreambnc.xyz, thebest.dreambnc.xyz
		<h3>New Staff Member</h3>
		<p>Hello everyone! We would like to welcome a new staff member to our team: JoshyKb257! He will be hosting our service bot.</p>
		<h3>We're not dead!</h3>
                <p>Thanks to F4ncy, we have a new server, Mushroom. This server will be set up tomorrow and all users will be transferred. All account details will be the same. We also suggest you follow our Twitter, as we update that more often then this page.</p>		
                <h3>Keith</h3>
                <p>The server Keith will be expiring on the 17th, meaning that if we don't get a new server by then, we'll be closing.</p>
                <h3>New website</h3>
				<p>We've gotten a new website hosted on GitHub Pages. It's mainly written by HG.</p>
				<h3>Name change</h3>
				<p>We've changed our name from WBNC to DreamBNC. WBNC was the name of a radio station, and DreamBNC looks better for a professional BNC provider.</p>
